    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        While looking for potential datasets for this project, the search was heavily influenced by the play animation of Assignment 2, that animated the locations of murders in NYC over time.
        This directed the focus, during the search for interesting datasets, towards those containing geo locations and timestamps, in order to create a similar style of animation.
        The central dataset, that was settled on, is based on a network of pedestrian sensors in the city on Melbourne.
        The dataset contains the amount of hourly registrations for each sensor and was chosen because it provides a solid foundation for an interesting map based visualization, the idea of exploring the driving forces behind pedestrian movement in a major city seemed interesting and multiple other datasets and statistics about Melbourne's population, weather and employment exist, that could be used to supplement the main dataset in order to create an narrative.
        The focus for the userâ€™s experience was to provide a highly interactive visualisation that provides an overview of the daily pedestrian movement as well each sensors registrations.
